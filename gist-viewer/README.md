This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It includes GraphQL and Prisma with PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

Create a .env file with the PostgreSQL connection in the root with the database info.

Example:
```javascript
DATABASE_URL="postgres://username:password@dbname.db.elephantsql.com/username"
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

I spent about 7 hours researching and about 6 hours coding. I used my UI from my portfolio website to speed up the design process.
